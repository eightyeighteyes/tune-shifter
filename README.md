# tune-shifter

A background daemon that automates the full ingest pipeline for a digital audio library — from Bandcamp purchase to tagged, art-embedded, organized file in your library — with no manual steps.

Built with Python 3 by [Claude Sonnet 4.6](https://www.anthropic.com/claude).

---

## Features

- **Bandcamp auto-download** — polls your Bandcamp collection for new purchases and downloads them automatically; authenticates via a one-time interactive browser login (no credentials stored)
- **Automatic tagging** — looks up every release on [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) and writes canonical tags (artist, album artist, album, year, track number, disc number, MusicBrainz IDs)
- **Cover art** — fetches front cover art from the [MusicBrainz Cover Art Archive](https://coverartarchive.org), validates minimum dimensions (≥ 1000 × 1000 px) and maximum file size (≤ 1 MB), and embeds it in every track
- **Filesystem watcher** — monitors your staging directory; drop a ZIP or folder in and it is processed automatically
- **Configurable library layout** — moves finished files into your library using a template you control (`{album_artist}/{year} - {album}/{track:02d} - {title}.{ext}`)
- **Error quarantine** — failed items are moved to `staging/errors/` so nothing loops or blocks the queue
- **Error notifications** — macOS system notifications for pipeline failures (extraction, tagging, artwork, download) and Bandcamp sync failures
- **macOS menu bar** — optional status-bar icon with pipeline Play/Stop toggle, on-demand Bandcamp sync, and a live sync status indicator with pulse animation
- **Background service** — one command registers the daemon as a system service that starts at login (macOS launchd)
- **Cross-platform** — macOS, Linux, and Windows (Python 3.11+)

## How it works

```
Bandcamp purchase
       │
       ▼
  [bandcamp.py] poll collection API → scrape download links → download ZIP → staging/
       │
       ▼
  [watcher.py] detects new ZIP or folder in staging/
       │
       ▼
  [extractor.py] unzip archive
       │
       ▼
  [tagger.py] MusicBrainz lookup → write tags
       │
       ▼
  [artwork.py] Cover Art Archive → embed cover
       │
       ▼
  [mover.py] render path template → move to library
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- A [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) contact email (required by their API policy — used only in the `User-Agent` header)
- For Bandcamp auto-download: a Bandcamp account

### Python dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `watchdog` | Filesystem event monitoring |
| `musicbrainzngs` | MusicBrainz release lookup |
| `mutagen` | Reading and writing audio tags (MP3, M4A, FLAC) |
| `requests` | HTTP client for the Cover Art Archive and session validation |
| `Pillow` | Image dimension validation |
| `playwright` | Headless browser for Bandcamp authentication and download |
| `rumps` | macOS menu bar integration (macOS only) |

---

## Installation

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap eightyeighteyes/tune-shifter
brew install tune-shifter
```

After install, download the Playwright browser binaries required for Bandcamp auto-download:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/opt/tune-shifter/venv/bin/playwright install chromium
```

zsh tab completion is included and activated automatically via Homebrew's shell integration.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eightyeighteyes/tune-shifter
cd tune-shifter
poetry install
playwright install chromium
```

---

## Configuration

On first run, tune-shifter creates a config file with defaults at:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux | `~/.config/tune-shifter/config.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\tune-shifter\config.toml` |

Edit it before starting:

```toml
[paths]
staging = "~/Music/staging"   # drop ZIPs here; tune-shifter watches this directory
library = "~/Music"           # finished files land here

[musicbrainz]
app_name = "tune-shifter"
app_version = "0.1.0"
contact = "you@example.com"   # required by MusicBrainz API policy

[artwork]
min_dimension = 1000          # minimum cover art width and height in pixels
max_bytes = 2_000_000         # maximum cover art file size (1 MB)

[library]
# Variables: {artist} {album_artist} {album} {year} {track} {disc} {title} {ext}
path_template = "{album_artist}/{year} - {album}/{track:02d} - {title}.{ext}"

# Optional: enable Bandcamp auto-download
[bandcamp]
username = "your-bandcamp-username"
format = "mp3-v0"             # mp3-v0 | mp3-320 | flac
poll_interval_minutes = 60    # 0 = polling disabled; use `tune-shifter sync` manually
# cookie_file = "~/.config/tune-shifter/cookies.txt"  # advanced: bypass interactive login
```

---

## Usage

### Run the daemon

```bash
tune-shifter
# or explicitly:
tune-shifter daemon
```

Watches the staging directory for new ZIPs and folders, and (if `[bandcamp]` is configured) polls Bandcamp for new purchases on the configured interval.

Override paths without editing the config:

```bash
tune-shifter daemon --staging ~/Downloads/staging --library ~/Music
```

### macOS menu bar

On macOS the daemon shows a `music.note.list` status-bar icon by default. The menu provides:

| Item | Action |
|---|---|
| **Stop / Play** | Pause or resume the ingest pipeline without stopping the process |
| **Bandcamp Sync** | Trigger an immediate sync; grayed out if `[bandcamp]` is not configured |
| **Sync Status** | Read-only: "Status: Idle" or "Status: Syncing…" (icon pulses during sync) |
| **Bandcamp Logout** | Delete the saved session and sync state; the next sync will re-authenticate |
| **About Tune-Shifter** | Opens the project GitHub page |
| **Quit** | Shuts down the daemon and removes the menu bar icon |

To run without the menu bar icon:

```bash
tune-shifter daemon --no-menu-bar
tune-shifter install-service --no-menu-bar  # persists the preference in the launchd plist
```

---

### Run as a background service (macOS)

Register tune-shifter as a launchd user agent so it starts at login and runs silently in the background:

```bash
tune-shifter install-service
```

Logs are written to `~/.local/share/tune-shifter/daemon.log`.

```bash
tune-shifter stop              # pause the service
tune-shifter play              # resume the service
tune-shifter status            # check if it's running
tune-shifter uninstall-service # remove it permanently
```

### View or update config from the command line

```bash
tune-shifter config show
tune-shifter config set paths.staging ~/Downloads/staging
tune-shifter config set musicbrainz.contact me@example.com
tune-shifter config set artwork.min_dimension 500
```

Keys use dot notation (`section.field`). Run `tune-shifter config set --help` to see all valid keys.

### Test notifications (macOS)

Verify that macOS notification permissions are granted and the full notification path works by simulating a failure at a specific pipeline stage:

```bash
tune-shifter test-notify --type extraction  # simulate extraction failure
tune-shifter test-notify --type tagging     # simulate MusicBrainz tagging failure
tune-shifter test-notify --type artwork     # simulate cover art warning
tune-shifter test-notify --type move        # simulate library move failure
tune-shifter test-notify --type download    # simulate Bandcamp sync failure
```

Each command runs the real pipeline (or syncer) up to the named stage, injects a failure, and fires a notification via the same code path the daemon uses — so if the notification appears, the full chain is working.

---

### One-shot Bandcamp sync

```bash
tune-shifter sync
```

Downloads any purchases not yet in your local state, places them in staging, and exits. The watcher (if running) picks them up automatically.

### Bootstrap: mark your existing collection as synced

If you've already downloaded everything in your Bandcamp collection manually, run this once before your first sync to prevent re-downloading it all:

```bash
tune-shifter sync --mark-synced
```

This fetches your full collection and records every item ID in the state file without downloading any files. Subsequent `sync` runs (and the daemon) will only pick up purchases made after this point.

### Log out of Bandcamp

To delete the saved session and force re-authentication on the next sync:

```bash
tune-shifter logout
```

This also clears the sync state file, so the next sync will re-examine your full collection. Use this if your session expires or you want to switch accounts.

### Manual ingest

Drop any Bandcamp ZIP or already-extracted folder into your staging directory. The daemon processes it within a few seconds.

## Supported formats

- MP3
- AAC / M4A
- FLAC
- OGG Vorbis

## Bandcamp auto-download

> **Note:** Bandcamp has no public API. The collection endpoints used here are reverse-engineered and could change without notice. No passwords are stored.

On first sync, tune-shifter opens a browser window and prompts you to log in to Bandcamp. Once you complete login the window closes automatically and the session is saved. Subsequent syncs (and the background daemon) reuse the saved session without opening a browser — you only need to log in again if your Bandcamp session expires.

The session file and download state are stored alongside each other:

| Platform | Directory |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux | `~/.local/share/tune-shifter/` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tune-shifter\` |

The session file (`bandcamp_session.json`) is written with owner-only permissions (`0600`). The state file (`bandcamp_state.json`) tracks which purchases have been downloaded so nothing is ever re-downloaded.

---

## Development

```bash
poetry install
playwright install chromium
poetry run pytest      # run tests
poetry run mypy tune_shifter/     # type check
poetry run black tune_shifter/ tests/  # format
```
